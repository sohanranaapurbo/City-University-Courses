1.create table example:
		
		CREATE TABLE library(std_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
							name varchar(20),
							gender varchar(25),
							department INT(15),
							books_amount INT(25),
							PRIMARY KEY(std_id));


2. INSERT INTO example:

				INSERT INTO library(std_id, name, gender, department,books_amount)
				VALUES('211','Israt','Female','CSE','2'),
				(' ','Jahan','Female','BBA','3'),
				(' ','Santa','Female','EEE','5'),
				(' ','Apurbo','Male','CE','10');

3. ORDER BY example 
				SELECT * FROM library
   				ORDER BY name DESC;
				SELECT * FROM library1
   				ORDER BY name DESC;

4. BETWEEN example
				SELECT std_id,name
 				FROM library1
				WHERE books_quantity
				BETWEEN 3 AND 10;

5. IN example

				SELECT Name
				FROM library1
				WHERE book_quantity IN (3,5,10);

6. INNER JOIN example with schema:
							
							library(std_id, name, gender, department,books_amount)
							employee(emp_id, emp_name, address, mobile,std_id)

							SELECT library1.std_id, employee.emp_id
							FROM library1
							INNER JOIN employee
							ON library.std_id=employee.std_id;

7. ALIAS example:

			SELECT Name, gender AS std_Details
				From library;

8. ALTER TABLE example

					ALTER TABLE hospital
					ADD patient_address varchar(25);

9. CASE example

			SELECT std_id,name,department,
CASE
    WHEN department = 'CSE' THEN 'Students of Engeneering Faculty'
    WHEN department = 'BBA' THEN 'Students of Business Faculty'
    WHEN department = 'LAW' THEN 'Students of Law Faculty'
    WHEN department = 'EEE' THEN 'Students of Sciencce Faculty'

    ELSE 'Unknown department'
END AS department_name
FROM library1;



10. View Table example:


CREATE VIEW Students_view AS
SELECT name, gender
FROM  library1;
